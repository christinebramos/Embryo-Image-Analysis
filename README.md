### Updated January 23, 2020

## Introduction

Under the instruction of Dr. Aaron Ohta, this repository contains the updated work regarding the VIP Microrobotics, Embryo Image Analysis subteam. The goal of this project is to develop a method to accurately (with less than 5% significant difference) analyze the growth of an embryo over time to determine the best embryo for in-vitro fertilization. This project is in collaboration with Dr. T.T.F Huang and graduate student Yousuf Harun.
