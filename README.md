# Embryo-Image-Analysis
### Updated January 23, 2020

## Introduction

Under the instruction of Dr. Aaron Ohta, this repository contains the updated work regarding the VIP Microrobotics, Embryo Image Analysis subteam. The goal of this project is to develop a method to accurately (with less than 5% significant difference) analyze the growth of an embryo over time to determine the best embryo for in-vitro fertilization. This project is in collaboration with Dr. T.T.F Huang and graduate student Yousuf Harun. 

## Current Work
Our current work is to complete the translation of MATLAB scripts into Python, identify methods to transfer neural networks between computers, develop a user-friendly interface for a trained neural network to operate on different files, and to output the data as a CSV file with corresponding infographics.

## MATLAB
In the updated MATLAB directory, the most recent MATLAB scripts regarding the three scripts used to train the neural network UNET can be found. 

For documentation purposes, old scripts that were developed on MATLAB can be found in the Old MATLAB directory. 

## Python
In the Python directory, the current Python implementation of the MATLAB scripts can be found.
